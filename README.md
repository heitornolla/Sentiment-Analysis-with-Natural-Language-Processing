# Bravium-NLP

General Steps:

Env config -> EDA -> Data Cleaning -> NLP -> Benchmark

## Environment Setup
It is always recommended to have a separate python environment for different projects. This projects utilizes `Python 3.12`. We walk you through the environment configuration with multiple package managers, but recommend building the project's Docker image for ease of use.

We also try to ensure the notebooks can be executed on Colab, although some packages may need to be installed manually 

### Docker
TBD

### Colab
Resolve missing package erorrs by running 
```bash
!pip install <package-name>
``` 
Will be fixed on the final release.

### Poetry
```bash
poetry install no-root
``` 

### Conda
